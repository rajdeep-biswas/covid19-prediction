Unary labelled dataset-
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning

ideas from the above link
anomaly detection
neural network models, the self-organizing map (SOM) and adaptive resonance theory (ART)
(shall we try these on the all positive dataset?)
concern 1: we can try a lot of clustering methods but i cant think of a way of making sure if it's correct
concern 2: i need help visualizing multidimensional data clusters, if at all visually analyzing the clusters would be any useful
concern 3: number of clusters should ideally be just 1 but should there be more?

* cross validation pending on naive bayes, logres

Creating datasets of healthy citizens-
concern 1: we cannot assign age, gender, location values RANDOMLY even if we could check if they exist in the database and disinclude those ones that are already there
idea 1: we can use latest census data and subtract our COVID poistive dataset from it (but i just found out latest census was in 2011)
